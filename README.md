## Battle Chip
Game Challenge @ Academia de CÃ³digo 

BattleChip was a team project made on week 4 of the Code Academy bootcamp - an educational game whose main characters are two chips battling against each other, as if they were electric shock-throwing tanks, in order to teach kids about basic computer science concepts. This project is the first level of a game intended to make its users climb the abstraction ladder and garner knowledge in the process!
